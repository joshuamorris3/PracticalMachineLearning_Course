<ul>
	<li>Cross validation - since we can&#39;t use the test set for modelling, use the training set by breaking it up into training and test sets
	<ul>
		<li>Use 60% training, 20% testing, 20% validation</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Will we need to remove zero covariates?</li>
	<li>PCA - use to reduce the number of predictors (variables)</li>
	<li>Trees
	<ul>
		<li>perhaps useful to predict with trees (better in nonlinear settings)</li>
		<li>Without cross validation can lead to overfitting</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
